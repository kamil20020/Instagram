# Instagram copy 
This app is mostly a simplified copy of Instagram in terms of its functions and website layout. This project is not done yet, but i am working on it regulary. Project is divided on 2 parts: first part is containing basic functions of instagram e.g. posts and other part is real time chat.

At this moment almost all basic instagram functions are done. I've not started working on chat yet.

## Runing app
Im my opinion the best way to run this app is to use docker-compose.yml file and command `docker-compose up`. To run app this way it is required to have docker installed.

Details:
* In http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui/index.html#/ there is API specificaiton,
* In http://localhost:3000 there is frontend,
* After database launch, backend is creating schema for database by Liquibase and then also by backend test data is loaded,
* On the start mainly 3 accounts are created:
